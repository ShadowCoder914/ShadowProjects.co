          <h4>ShadowProjectsCreativeStudios<br><br>How it all began  </h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            ShadowProjectsCreativeStudios was created as a Software
            & Art organization. It's founder Shamari Hankins, has always
            prided himself on pushing for excellence in everything that he does.
            Born in Far Rockaway-New York in the Queens area;
            He grew up in middle-class homes for most of his life. He attended
            elementary and middle schools early on in New York, and did some
            years in junior-high in the state of Georgia. This was due to rising
            inflations, and a flourishing yet struggling mother and father due to
            the economy's inflated pricing and conditions. Shamari then ;
            would go on to finish high-school in New york state. He mentions he
            was always into technology and the creative arts ever since a mere child.
           <br>
            He recalls and attributes most if not all of his drive and determination to
            growing up playing sports, being very athletic and motivated, and always 
            pushing to challenge himself.
